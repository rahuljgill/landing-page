SO THE TASK IS-----

The website you’re creating has 4 main sections (and a footer)
so pick one and get it into pretty good shape before moving on. Starting at the top is always a solid plan.


 do the HTML and then do the CSS.


 You do not need to make this project responsive. That means you don’t have to adjust your design for different screen sizes, zoom levels, or mobile devices. For now, just focus on making it look good on a regular computer screen.
